# Hybrid Bookshelf #

This is the open source version of the hybrid bookshelf. A [commercial version](http://www.hybridbookshelf.de/#welcome) with additional features and support is offered by [picibird](http://www.picibird.com). 

The project started off with the master thesis [Blended Shelf](http://zenodo.org/record/17947#.V0QpQZGLRaQ) of [Eike Kleinert](http://www.eikekleiner.de/) at the [human-computer interaction department](http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/) at [the University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/). The thesis evaluates a 3D bookshelf metaphor to visualize and interact with books and ebooks in a natural and appealing way and is part of the research project [Blended Library](http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/index.php?a=research&b=projects&c=8609071). Convinced by the prototype's potential the [Kommunikations-, Informations-, Medienzentrum (KIM)](https://www.kim.uni-konstanz.de/) library service of the university of Konstanz started the hybrid bookshelf project funded by the [MWK Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg](https://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/ministerium/). The   software startup [picibird](http://www.picibird.com/) which specialized in HCI won the contract and is developing the Hybrid Bookshelf and services around it.

## Nuget Server

We host our own [nuget server](http://nuget.picibits.com/api/v2/) to distribute our picibits app development library. We aim to go open source with picibits in 2017. This project's src folder includes a **nuget.config** file so visual studio should automatically pick up our nuget server. If not apply http://nuget.picibits.com/api/v2/ manually.

## Build ##

* visual studio 2015 (uses .net 4.6 portable class libraries)
* nuget 3.0 or later
* restore nuget packages if not automatically
* set **hbs.wpf.demo** as startup project
